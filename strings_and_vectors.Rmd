## Strings and manipulations
```{r}
string_vec = c("My", "name", "is", "Cj")
str_detect(string_vec, "Cj")
str_detect(string_vec, "e")
str_replace(string_vec, "Cj", "CJ")
```

```{r}
new_string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun, actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
)

str_detect(new_string_vec, "i think")
str_detect(new_string_vec, "^i think") ##^ is line start
str_detect(new_string_vec, "i think$") ##$ is line end
```

```{r}
pumpkin_string_vec = c(
  "Time for a Pumpkin Spice Latte!",
  "went to the #pumpkinpatch last weekend",
  "Pumpkin Pie is obviously the best pie",
  "SMASHING PUMPKINS -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
)

str_detect(pumpkin_string_vec, "Pumpkin")
str_detect(pumpkin_string_vec, "[Pp]umpkin")
```

```{r}
number_string_vec = c(
  "7th inning stretch",
  "1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.",
  "she is 5 feet 4 inches tall",
  "3AM - can't sleep :("
)

str_detect(number_string_vec, "[0-9]") 

str_detect(number_string_vec, "^[0-9]")

str_detect(number_string_vec, "^[0-9][a-z]")
```

```{r}
dots_string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(dots_string_vec, "7.11") ## the dot is a wild card and matches anything

```


```{r}
brack_string_vec = c(
  "The CI is [2,5]",
  ":-]",
  ":-[",
  "I found the answer on pages [6-7]"
)

str_detect(brack_string_vec, "\\[") #use backslash to denote special character; backslash itself is also a special character so you need to do it again
str_detect(brack_string_vec, "\\[[0-9]" )


```
